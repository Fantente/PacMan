## Project Plan

Find the images.

https://www.spriters-resource.com/fullview/52631/

Find a way to cut/ extract the images.

This kind of images are called `spritesheets`.

There is an online cutter https://ezgif.com/sprite-cutter

Isn't there a way w/ code?

https://medium.com/dailyjs/how-to-build-a-simple-sprite-animation-in-javascript-b764644244aa

This looks like a more proper way and a reason not to use BlockLike...

Asked Ron if he thinks it makes sense to add the sprit sheet support to blocklike.

NEXT TIME

Animate only the PacMan.

Create and move the PacMan w/ the arrows.

Generate the dots.

Make the PacMan eat the dots.

Mantra

* Watch out for AstroPi 2022 `!!`
  * https://astro-pi.org
  * Nothing yet.

14:30

* Check Homework
  * See to fix this place in the code as it sometimes works slowly and somtimest fast `different approach, but perfect result, bravo :)`

                    // HOMEWORK
                    // Sometimes works, sometimes does not :)
* Today
  * Make PacMan follow the corridors.
    * There are two options.
      * Read the colours `we will not do this`
        * This is useful if
          * We want to do it like this, or
          * There are different labyrinths
      * w/ many IFs the same way you have done the ends of the labyrinth
        * This means for every direction we have to create an array of limitations (or extend the array of limitations you have already started) `we began working on this and have proof of concept`

### Homework

* Fix the start direction.
* Fix the end of labirynth logic.
* Try to add more/ all points where the direction can change.

## Backlog

Focus

`together`

* Continue to move the Google Docs in git: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1LUrJoPXNlQv849iD-L1eSOrUzqjsJptFLizNlU0gdyY/
