# PacMan

![](logo.png)

## Netelify

## Project Plan

Find the images.

https://www.spriters-resource.com/fullview/52631/

Find a way to cut/ extract the images.

This kind of images are called `spritesheets`.

There is an online cutter https://ezgif.com/sprite-cutter

Isn't there a way w/ code?

https://medium.com/dailyjs/how-to-build-a-simple-sprite-animation-in-javascript-b764644244aa

This looks like a more proper way and a reason not to use BlockLike...

Asked Ron if he thinks it makes sense to add the sprit sheet support to blocklike.

NEXT TIME

Animate only the PacMan.

Create and move the PacMan w/ the arrows.

Generate the dots.

Make the PacMan eat the dots.

Today

* Auto-Return
  * ...
  * Switch to TypeScript
* Crossings

Homework

* See why AutoReturn does not toggle `te` and `km`

# 12 March

  * Make the PacMan also follow the button
  * done!
* Progressed w/ some

Homework

* Kian to try some on row 122, 123
* We continue tomorrow

* Learn to work w/ boolean in if ... else ... statements.
  * TypeScript
* Learn about the scope of variables and create examples.
## 12 February

* Check Homework
  * Move the comparison to one dimentsional arrays `done`
  * Make the teleport work :) `done`
  * Many coordinates in the multidimensional array have been prepared `done`
* Learned Today
  * The Google PacMan has a gradual teleport.
  * Security
    * We found out that if you close the tab, the direction remains.
    * This is a security problem.
  * JavaScript Array Prototype
    * https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_prototype_array.asp
    * prototype allows you to add new properties and methods to arrays.
    * prototype is a property available with all JavaScript objects.
  * Programming
    * Reference is not a Tutorial
      * Referende is the shortest description possible, and can be frustrating when you do not understand it.
      * In such cases look for a Tutorial, where there can be more explanation.
  * English and Programming
    * hunch
      * A feeling or guess based on intuition rather than fact.
  * Think how best to cycle thorugh the multidimentional array.
    * The built-in fuctions are faster than writing the same in JavaScript.
    * callback or anonyme function extends built-in functions in a more efficient way, than writing everything in JavaScript yourself
      * array.some will work
* Homework
  * Mission Zero `above`
  * PacMan
    * Research DO `do this first`
      * Array, Feld https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feld_(Datentyp) 
      * Read about array.some
        * https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/some 
    * Think how to make the teleport come from the dark, gradually.
    * Security
      * We must clear the global store on tab close `research`

## Backlog

Focus

`together`

* Continue to move the Google Docs in git: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1LUrJoPXNlQv849iD-L1eSOrUzqjsJptFLizNlU0gdyY/
