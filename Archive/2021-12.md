* Today
  * Make PacMan follow the corridors.
    * There are two options.
      * Read the colours `we will not do this`
        * This is useful if
          * We want to do it like this, or
          * There are different labyrinths
      * w/ many IFs the same way you have done the ends of the labyrinth
        * This means for every direction we have to create an array of limitations (or extend the array of limitations you have already started) `we began working on this and have proof of concept`

### Homework

* Fix the start direction.
* Fix the end of labirynth logic.
* Try to add more/ all points where the direction can change.
