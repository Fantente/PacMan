* Check Homework
  * Fix the start direction `done`
  * Fix the end of labirynth logic `done`
  * Try to add more/ all points where the direction can change `done`
* Learned Today
  * How to shorten comparisons w/ array()
  * How to check if a number is in the array()
  * Introduction into Analysis :)
    * Analysed how to combine an array w/ all crossings and all possible directions in each crossing and how to examine it.
* Homework
  * Move all comparison to one dimentsional arrays `km`
  * Think how best to cycle thorugh the multidimentional array `km` `te`
    * array.some `?`
  * Make the teleport work :) `km`

* Check Homework
  * Move the comparison to one dimentsional arrays `done`
  * Make the teleport work :) `done`
  * Many coordinates in the multidimensional array have been prepared `done`
* Learned Today
  * The Google PacMan has a gradual teleport.
  * Security
    * We found out that if you close the tab, the direction remains.
    * This is a security problem.
  * JavaScript Array Prototype
    * https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_prototype_array.asp
    * prototype allows you to add new properties and methods to arrays.
    * prototype is a property available with all JavaScript objects.
  * Programming
    * Reference is not a Tutorial
      * Referende is the shortest description possible, and can be frustrating when you do not understand it.
      * In such cases look for a Tutorial, where there can be more explanation.
  * English and Programming
    * hunch
      * A feeling or guess based on intuition rather than fact.
  * Think how best to cycle thorugh the multidimentional array.
    * The built-in fuctions are faster than writing the same in JavaScript.
    * callback or anonyme function extends built-in functions in a more efficient way, than writing everything in JavaScript yourself
      * array.some will work
* Homework
  * Mission Zero `above`
  * PacMan
    * Research DO `do this first`
      * Read about array.some
        * https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/some 
    * Think how to make the teleport come from the dark, gradually.
    * Remove the automatic turning at the end of the corridor.
      * Consider to leave it on a specific place.
      * For example paint a corner red and let it happen there.
    * Security
      * We must clear the global store on tab close `research`
