* Infrastructure
  * GitHub
    * Switch to own GitHub `done`
      * https://github.com/Fantente/PacMan
  * Netelify
    * https://pacman-dahoum.netlify.app
* Mantra
  * When something does not look you should check the console log `Kian`
  * The better you understand the subject matter/ Fachbereich, the better you can help with software `Kian`
* Organisation
  * Kian must work 1 hour a week alone and write a report in Discord.
    * This is independent from our call.
* Today
  * We fixed that PacMan stops on a crossing if the direction is not allowed and goes through walls on the first key after such a stop.
    * We fixed it by separating the change of direct from can I continue in this direction on a crossing logic.
* Homework
  * Think how to introduce a Ghost `Kian`
