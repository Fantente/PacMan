## Project Plan

Find the images.

https://www.spriters-resource.com/fullview/52631/

Find a way to cut/ extract the images.

This kind of images are called `spritesheets`.

There is an online cutter https://ezgif.com/sprite-cutter

Isn't there a way w/ code?

https://medium.com/dailyjs/how-to-build-a-simple-sprite-animation-in-javascript-b764644244aa

This looks like a more proper way and a reason not to use BlockLike...

Asked Ron if he thinks it makes sense to add the sprit sheet support to blocklike.

NEXT TIME

Animate only the PacMan.

Create and move the PacMan w/ the arrows.

Generate the dots.

Make the PacMan eat the dots.

12:00 w/ Kian, dahoum

* Check all crossings and add the missing `HOMEWORK` `done`
* How do we stop when we face a wall `HOMEWORK` `in progress`
  * There is double logic for this: the crossings array and some other, which we began to remove (Right) `in progress`
  * Finish Left, Up and Down `HOMEWORK`
  * Afterwards we should fix the Auto Return `NEXT`
* Generalise the move_actor() function so that it can move both pacman and blinky `HOMEWORK` `NEXT TIME`

## 31 July

### Homework From Last Time



### Ask someone

* How do we avoid overwriting each others changes?

### Today

* Try to think of a solution how not to continue through walls when the direction continues.
  * 31 July
    * We have 1/3 of the solution. We split the logic on the crossing to see if the direction is allowed or not.
    * Now we have to add logic on two-three more places `homework for km`

### Homework

* Solve all TODOs `km`
* Try to create "stop at a wall" logic `km`

### 9 July

Learned Today

* https://github.com/postgres
  * a lot of comments
  * less than 5 lines of code per block
  * separation of control structure from functions

Next Time

* begin separating the logic from the functions

### 5 June

NEXT

* Begin w/ characters! :) Fun!

### 12 March

Long Term Homework

* Learn to work w/ boolean in if ... else ... statements.
  * TypeScript
* Learn about the scope of variables and create examples.
### 12 February

* Learned Today
  * The Google PacMan has a gradual teleport.
  * Security
    * We found out that if you close the tab, the direction remains.
    * This is a security problem.
  * JavaScript Array Prototype
    * https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_prototype_array.asp
    * prototype allows you to add new properties and methods to arrays.
    * prototype is a property available with all JavaScript objects.
  * Programming
    * Reference is not a Tutorial
      * Referende is the shortest description possible, and can be frustrating when you do not understand it.
      * In such cases look for a Tutorial, where there can be more explanation.
  * English and Programming
    * hunch
      * A feeling or guess based on intuition rather than fact.
  * Think how best to cycle thorugh the multidimentional array.
    * The built-in fuctions are faster than writing the same in JavaScript.
    * callback or anonyme function extends built-in functions in a more efficient way, than writing everything in JavaScript yourself
      * array.some will work

### Backlog

Focus

`together`

* Continue to move the Google Docs in git: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1LUrJoPXNlQv849iD-L1eSOrUzqjsJptFLizNlU0gdyY/
